"""Render dispatch for the binned-count charts (#524).

`plot.mojo` calls one entry point per family instead of importing every
mark's render function and branching over every `Mark`. Adding a mark
touches this file and its own module rather than the hub.

The "not mine" answer is an empty `Optional`. `_RenderResult` is
`Movable` but not `Copyable`, and this function is generic over
`T: DrawTarget` because `_render_generic` is, so that combination was
checked in a spike before the design rather than assumed to work.
